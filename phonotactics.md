# 'aluko - Phonotactics

The syllable structure in 'aluko is (C)(C)V(L) | N where:

- C is a consonant.
- V is a vowel.
- L is a coda-consonant: a liquid (one of `wrlj`), a non-palatal nasal (one of `mn`), or the sibilant(`s`).
- N is a nasal (one of `mnñ`).\
Note: `|` is the logical OR operator.

## Exceptions

- When a syllable ends in a vowel, the next one (if it exists) cannot start with another vowel.
- A glottal stop(`'`) cannot preceed any consonants and cannot proceed any consonants that aren't part of the previous syllable's coda.
- Two neighboring consonants at the start of a syllable cannot have the same place and manner of articulation.
- If a syllable starts with a liquid, then it cannot be followed by another consonant.

> Note: `/nj/` is an allophoneme of `/ɲ/` and not a distinct syllable on its own.

## Non-differantiating factors

These describe cases where two syllables are too phonemically similar to be distuinguished (meaning that there cannot be two words whose only difference is a non-differentiating factor).

- Stress.
- Vowel length.
- Consonants with the same place and manner of articulation.

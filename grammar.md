# 'aluko - Grammar

Here are some general properties of 'aluko's grammar:

- It is a pro-drop language, meaning that if no *Subject* is specified for a verb, the matching *Personal Pronoun* of that *Verb* is the implied *Subject*.
- The word order is VSO (*Verb* - *Subject* - *Object*).
- Additionally, *Direct Objects* are placed after *Indirect Objects*. Similarly, *Attributes* are placed after their describing *Nominal Terms*.
- *Adverbs* are placed at the beginning of each clause, and *Prepositions* are placed at the end.

## Nominal Terms

- All nominal terms exhibit *Case* and *Number*
- The following are the cases of 'aluko:

| **Case**      | **Usage**                                   | **Marker**  |
| ------------: | :-----------------------------------------: | :---------- |
| Nominative    | Marks the subject of a clause               | `c`-        |
| Accusative    | Marks the direct object of a clause         | `f`-        |
| Dative        | Marks the indirect object of a clause       | `þ`-        |
| Genitive      | Marks the possessor of another nominal term | `s`-        |
| Prepositional | Marks the object of a preposition           | `x`-        |

### Nominal Numbers

| **Category** | **Usage**                                                 | **Marker** |
| -----------: | :-------------------------------------------------------: | :--------- |
| Abstract     | Non-countable terms or cases when number isn't important. | -ø         |
| Singular     | Refers to singular objects/items/terms.                   | -`n`       |
| Plural       | Refers to multiple objects/items/terms.                   | -`s`       |

### Nouns

*Nouns* are the simplest kind of *Nominal Term*. They have no additional functionality.

### Adjectives

Adjectives in 'aluko don't consistute a distinct word class. However, a *Noun* whose meaning is such that can be used as an *Attribute* can function as one depending on the context. When this happens, the "adjective" noun must proceed its describing *Nominal Term* and encapsulate it, forming an Adjectival Modifier (that contains both the *Attribute* and the described *Nominal Term*). Note that these two have to agree in case and number.

### Pronouns

*Pronouns* are words that replace concrete *Nominal Terms* to refer to a concept either using more abstract ideas or to avoid repetition or overt specificity. They can also be used in case where categorization of terms in quantities or groups is not easily achievable (e.g. the English sentence "all people" is used instead naming all people individually, which is not possible).

Types of *Pronouns* include *Personal Pronouns*, *Demonstrative Pronouns*, *Interrogative Pronouns*, etc... (T.B.D). For more info, see [the relative Dictionary section](./dictionary.md#other-types-of-pronouns).

#### Personal Pronouns

*Personal Pronouns* are, like in English, declined just like any *Nominal Term*, but also conjugated according to *Person*. Specifically, every *Personal Pronoun* takes the form of *Case Marker* + *Person Marker* (e.g. the word `me` would be `fom` in 'aluko). For a table containing all inflections of the personal pronouns, see [the Dictionary](./dictionary.md#pronoun-inflections).

## Vowel Reduplication

Whenever two morphemes are linked and they do not form valid syllables, the inital vowel of the proceeding syllable is inserted between them as a monophthong to ensure correct phonotactical behavior. Note that this does *not* happen with the consonants `n` and `j`, which are invalid as a consonant cluster, but "merge" to form `ñ`.

## Persons

- There exist 3 persons in 'aluko, *First Person* (relating to the speaker), *Second Person* (relating to the listener), and *Third Person* (relating to somebody else). In their plural forms, the respective persons also refer to additional people other than their relative point, so the *Second Person Plural* refers to both the listener as well as additional people. For the *First Person*, there exist both an *Inclusive Plural* as well as an *Exclusive Plural*, which determine whether the listener is included in the additional people specified via *Plurality*.

| **Persons**                   | **Marker** | **English Equivalent**  |
| ----------------------------: | :--------: | :---------------------- |
| 1st Person Singular           | `om`-      | I                       |
| 2nd Person Singular           | `al`-      | You (singular)          |
| 3rd Person Singular           | `ur`-      | He/she/it               |
| 1st Person Exclusive Plural   | `em`-      | We (excluding listener) |
| 1st Person Inclusive Plural   | `el`-      | We (including listener) |
| 2nd Person Plural             | `ar`-      | You (plural)            |
| 3rd Person Plural             | `in`-      | They (plural)           |

## Verbs

Verbs are conjugated based on person and tense. The order in which these are specified is TPR, where T is the tense of the verb, P is the person and R is the verb root/infinitive. Note that mood is also a conveyed factor that is not part of the verb's conjugation, but specified according to the following table (note that these precede the verb).

| **Mood**      | **Particle** |
| ------------: | :----------- |
| Indicative    | -            |
| Subjunctive   | ki           |
| Imperative    | to           |
| Optative      | be           |
| Interrogative | uwu          |

| **Tense** | **Marker** |
| --------: | :--------- |
| Present   | ø-         |
| Past      | `p`-       |
| Future    | `g`-       |

> Note: ø is used to signify the absence of a sound.

### Infinitives

*Infinitives* are *Verb Terms* that fulfill a nominal role, and as such, they receive no conjugation. Instead, the root of its corresponding *Verb* is declined using regular nominal declension rules.

## Adverbial Terms

### Adverbs

*Adverbs* are the simplest form of *Adverbial Modifiers*, which are descriptors that convey useful information about the context(location, time, direction, degree, cause, manner, etc...) that an action takes place in.

### Prepositions

*Prepositions* are a type of modifier that can functions as *Attributive* and others as *Adverbial*. They function similar to adverbs, except that they also take an object, that must be in the *Prepositional Case*.

> Note: The word *Marker* refers to a morpheme used to specify or differentiate between grammatical features/properties.

## Particles

*Particles* are types of words that don't fit neatly into a strict class but are used to introduce a specific grammatical construct.

### Conjunctions

*Conjunctions* are *Particles* that are used to connect different words, phrases or clauses semantically. They can be either *Coordinating* or *Subordinating*, depending on whether they join terms of equal importance or introduce *Subordinate Clauses*.

#### Coordinating Conjunctions

| **Conjunction** | **Type**    | **English Equivalent** |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| `ĩ`             | Additional  | And                    |
| `la`            | Alternative | Or                     |
| `vam`           | Contrastive | But                    |
| `zoj`           | Resulting   | So                     |

## Word Inversion

Inversion of 'aluko words is achievable by inverting the vowels they are consisted of according to the following table:

- `a` with `u`
- `i` with `e`

> Note: `o` has no equivalent inverse vowel and is considered neutral. Words whose syllables' nuclei are exclusively nasal and `o`s cannot be inverted to form a new word.

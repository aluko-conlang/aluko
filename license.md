# The Meow License 1.2

This license, henceforth referred to as "The Meow License," governs the use of the language covered by it ("The Language").

## 1. Preamble

Meow. Mwrrrrrp. Mraeoww. This document establishes the rights and responsibilities regarding The Language, ensuring that it remains free, open, and utterly unlicensable.

## 2. Rights and Permissions

- You may use, modify, and distribute The Language as much as you want.
- You may not claim ownership over The Language, as that would be ridiculous.
- You may hiss aggressively at anyone who attempts to impose licensing restrictions on The Language.

## 3. Restrictions

- Attempting to copyright, patent, or otherwise restrict access to The Language will result in immediate karmic repercussions.
- Any attempts to commercialize The Language under exclusive rights will be met with judgmental feline stares and probable claw swipes.

## 4. Liability

- The maintainers of The Language (if any) take no responsibility for any confusion, chaos, or existential crises that arise from its usage.
- If your cat disapproves of The Language, you must immediately cease its use and offer treats as an apology.

## 5. Final Clause

This license is immutable, eternal, and legally dubious at best. Any disputes shall be settled by the highest authority in feline jurisprudence: a very sleepy cat that does not care.

## 6. `static final` Clause
